# SDSC cern-roll

Th SDSC cern-roll contains the cern suite of software



clhep: (Class Library for High Energy Physics). Math libraries for vector math, random number generation and linear algebra
The Triton gnu-roll bundles a number of tools into a single Rocks(r) roll and provides a Modules interface to allow loading of the tool paths into the user environment.

## Roll Dependencies

The cern-roll requires that you first build and install the [gnucompiler-roll](https://github.com/sdsc/gnucompiler-roll) and the [gnu-roll] (https://github.com/sdsc/gnucompiler-roll) onto your Rocks(r) frontend or development appliance.

## Installed Programs

### root
